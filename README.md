UpQuiz 🎓

UpQuiz is a simple and flexible web-based quiz generator.
💡 Why I built this

The idea came up because the only tool available to practice for exams was a Telegram bot that was strictly in Italian. This was a huge limit for international students or anyone who didn't speak the language.

I wanted to break that barrier. I built UpQuiz to be a web platform where the language doesn't stop you. You can just upload your own files and generate your own quizzes, making it a fair and easy tool for everyone to use, regardless of where they are from or what language they speak.
✨ What it does

- No more language barriers: Built to be used with any content you upload.

- Web-based: Much more comfortable than a Telegram bot.

- Custom sets: Just upload your file and start practicing immediately.
